# 🧩 Project Segments from Consecutive End_Dates

## 🔍 Problem Summary
Group tasks into distinct projects if their `End_Date`s are consecutive. Each task is exactly 1 day. Identify the start and end dates for each project and sort by project length.

---

## 💡 Key Concepts
- Consecutive `End_Date`s mean the tasks belong to the same project.
- A new project starts if a `start_date` is **not present** in any `end_date`.
- A project ends if an `end_date` is **not followed** by a `start_date`.

## 🧠 Solution Steps

1. **CTE1**: Get `start_date`s that don't appear as any `end_date` → these are project starts.
2. **CTE2**: Rank them by date so we can match them later.
3. **CTE3**: Get `end_date`s that don't appear as any `start_date` → these are project ends.
4. **CTE4**: Rank them similarly.
5. **Final SELECT**: Join `CTE2` and `CTE4` on rank to pair the matching project start and end.
6. **ORDER** by `DATEDIFF` between start and end to get projects by duration.
