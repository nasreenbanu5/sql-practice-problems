GROUP BY salesperson;




Explanation
Goal: Pivot the sales table so that each salesperson has one row, and their monthly sales appear as columns (Jan, Feb, Mar).

CASE WHEN: Checks the mnth value for each record to match the desired month, and outputs the corresponding amount.

MIN(): Used to return a single value for each salesperson-month combination. Since each person has only one entry per month, MIN (or MAX) works equally well.

GROUP BY salesperson: Ensures each row of the final output is for one salesperson.
