CTE (cte)

Uses ROW_NUMBER() to assign a rank to each row within each station_id, ordered by temperature ascending.

Uses COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY station_id) to calculate the number of readings per station.

CTE (median)

Selects the row(s) that represent the middle of the ordered temperature list:

For odd count, both FLOOR((cnt + 1) / 2) and FLOOR((cnt + 2) / 2) are the same, selecting one middle value.

For even count, two middle values are selected.

Final SELECT

Aggregates the selected middle temperature values using AVG().

Rounds the result to 2 decimal places using ROUND()
