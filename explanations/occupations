First, it creates a temporary table (using a Common Table Expression or CTE) where each person is assigned a number (ROW_NUMBER) based on their occupation and sorted alphabetically. This number helps align people in rows later on.

Then, in the main query, it uses CASE WHEN statements to place each name under the correct occupation columnâ€”Doctor, Professor, Singer, or Actor.

Next, it uses MIN to safely extract the one name that matches the condition per row (since there's only one person per occupation per row number).

Finally, it groups all this by the row number, so each row in the output contains names from each occupation side-by-side. If an occupation has fewer people than others, the missing spots are filled with NULL.
