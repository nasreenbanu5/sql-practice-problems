Step 1: Generate a Sequence of Numbers

The query starts by generating a list of numbers beginning from 2 and ending at 999 using a recursive CTE.
It keeps adding 1 to the previous number until it reaches the upper limit. This creates a virtual table of all numbers in that range.

Step 2: Identify Prime Numbers

Next, the query filters this list to extract only the prime numbers.
For each number in the list, it checks whether there exists any smaller number (from the same list) that can divide it without a remainder.
If such a divisor exists, the number is not prime. If no such divisor is found, the number is considered prime and included in the result.

Step 3: Format the Output

Finally, all the identified prime numbers are combined into a single string, with each number separated by an ampersand (&).
This makes the output compact and easy to read or export.
