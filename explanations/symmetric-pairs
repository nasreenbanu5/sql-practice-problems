1. Identify Potential Symmetric Pairs
Use a self-join on the table to pair each row (X, Y) with any row that has (Y, X).

This ensures you capture all symmetric matches.

2. Prevent Duplicate Pair Output
Since both (X, Y) and (Y, X) will be returned by the join, apply a condition like X <= Y to keep only one version.

This ensures symmetry is only shown once, not twice.

3. Handle Identical Pairs Carefully
Pairs where X = Y (e.g., (20, 20)) could be falsely treated as symmetric on their own.

To validate these as true symmetric pairs, they must occur more than once in the table â€” i.e., you need at least two identical rows.

4. Use Grouping and Aggregation
Group the result by the pair values.

Apply HAVING conditions to:

Keep symmetric non-identical pairs.

Retain identical pairs only if they appear more than once.

5. Sort the Output
To match the required format and order, sort the result by the first and second elements of the pair.
