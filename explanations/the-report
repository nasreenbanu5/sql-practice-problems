✅ Step 1: Join Students and Grades Tables
Combine the students and grades tables using a condition.

Each student is matched with a grade based on their marks falling within a specific range defined by the grade (minimum and maximum marks).

This creates a meaningful connection between the student's marks and their corresponding grade level.

✅ Step 2: Use Conditional Logic for Displaying Names
Use a conditional expression to control whether a student’s name should be shown.

If a student's grade is less than 8, their name is hidden (replaced with a null value).

If the grade is 8 or higher, the student’s name is displayed normally.

✅ Step 3: Select Required Information
From the joined result, select three fields:

The student’s name (only if grade is 8 or more),

The grade,

The marks.

✅ Step 4: Order the Results
The final result is sorted by:

Grade in descending order (higher grades appear first),

Then by name in alphabetical order (if names are shown),

Then by marks in ascending order (for same grade and name).
