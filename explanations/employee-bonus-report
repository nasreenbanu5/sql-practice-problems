tep 1: Join Employees and Bonuses Tables
Combine the employees and bonuses tables using a condition.

Match each employee to a bonus level based on their salary falling within the minimum and maximum salary range defined in the bonuses table.

✅ Step 2: Conditional Display of Names
If the bonus level is less than 2, hide the employee's name (display null).

Otherwise, display the employee’s actual name.

This helps focus the report on mid-to-high bonus levels while still keeping other data visible.

✅ Step 3: Select Desired Output
Select four fields for the report:

Name (conditionally displayed),

Bonus level,

Salary,

Bonus amount (calculated as salary × percentage ÷ 100).

✅ Step 4: Sort the Final Output
Sort the final data:

First by bonus level in descending order (higher bonuses first),

Then by name alphabetically,

Then by salary in ascending order (for employees with same name and bonus level).
