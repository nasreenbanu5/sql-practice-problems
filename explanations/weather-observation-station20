Purpose:
This query calculates the median value of the lat_n column from the station table using MySQL 8+ features like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions.

How it works:

ordered CTE:

Selects the lat_n values from the station table.

Uses ROW_NUMBER() window function to assign a sequential row number (rn) to each lat_n, sorted in ascending order.

Uses COUNT(*) OVER () to calculate the total number of rows (cnt), which is repeated in every row.

middle CTE:

Filters rows from ordered to select the middle value(s).

If the total count cnt is odd, it selects the single middle row at position (cnt + 1) / 2.

If cnt is even, it selects the two middle rows at positions (cnt + 1) / 2 and (cnt + 2) / 2.

These two positions correspond to the middle two elements when the dataset has an even number of rows.

Final Select:

Computes the average of the selected middle value(s) using AVG(lat_n).

If there is one middle value (odd count), the average is just that value â€” the median.

If there are two middle values (even count), the average of these two is the median.

The result is rounded to 4 decimal places for precision.
